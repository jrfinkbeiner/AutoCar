# AutoCar

Unfinished project that was intended to serve as a car-racing/street simulation environment to test/explore different reinforcement-learning algorithms.

To use this repository just add the directory to your `PYTHONPATH`.

For a quick example just run `run.py` and test the (limited) GUI or check out the code.
